I have submitted two file which are assignment question 2 and Princess Ngoetjana assignment. Inside the Princess Ngoetjana file there are two files which are Student java and student management java. The Student java class contains a student's information. It includes fields for the student's ID, name, age, email, and course. It's a simple data container class.
